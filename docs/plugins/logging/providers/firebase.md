# Firebase

Coming Soon.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the platform restrictions of Firebase this is only brought in for Android. The AddProvider method is perfectly safe to use across any platform as the Firebase dependencies aren't referenced on outside of the Android runtime and is not actually registered with the container.
