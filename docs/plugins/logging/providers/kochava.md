# Kochava

Coming Soon

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the platform restrictions of Kochava this is only brought in for Android, iOS, & MacCatalyst. The AddProvider method is perfectly safe to use across any platform as the Kochava dependency isn't referenced on outside of those runtimes and is not actually registered with the container.
