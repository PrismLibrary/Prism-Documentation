# Custom Containers

For a variety of reasons the Prism team cannot support every container that developers may want to use. Prism makes it very easy to use a container that isn't officially supported or shipped by the Prism Library.

Prism imposes the following requirements in order to use a container:

- The container must be mutable to support Prism Modularity
- The container must support Transient and Singleton registrations
- The container must support registering a specified instance
- The container must support keyed registrations / resolving by name
- The container must support all three Prism platforms (WPF, UWP, Xamarin.Forms)

In this topic we wil be creating a conatiner extension for the Grace DI container.

## Create a New Project

The first step is to create a new project that will contain the code for your DI container extension.

## Adding a Container Extension

Next, add a new class to your project and implement the `IContainerExtension` interface.  The `IContainerExtension` interface is used to create a mapping for the most common registration and resolution methods.

In the case of the Grace DI container we simply need to add this single class:

```cs
public class GraceContainerExtension : IContainerExtension<IInjectionScope>
{
    public GraceContainerExtension()
        : this(new DependencyInjectionContainer())
    {
    }

    public GraceContainerExtension(IInjectionScope injectionScope)
    {
        Instance = injectionScope;
    }

    public IInjectionScope Instance { get; }

    public bool SupportsModules => true;

    public void FinalizeExtension() { }

    public IContainerRegistry Register(Type from, Type to)
    {
        Instance.Configure(c => c.Export(to).As(from));
        return this;
    }

    public IContainerRegistry Register(Type from, Type to, string name)
    {
        Instance.Configure(c => c.Export(to).AsKeyed(from, name));
        return this;
    }

    public IContainerRegistry RegisterInstance(Type type, object instance)
    {
        Instance.Configure(c => c.ExportInstance(instance).As(type));
        return this;
    }

    public IContainerRegistry RegisterSingleton(Type from, Type to) =>
        Instance.Configure(c => c.Export(to).As(from).Lifestyle.Singleton());

    public object Resolve(Type type) =>
        Instance.Locate(type);

    public object Resolve(Type type, string name) =>
        Instance.Locate(type, withKey: name);

    public object ResolveViewModelForView(object view, Type viewModelType)
    {
        Page page = null;

        switch(view)
        {
            case Page viewAsPage:
                page = viewAsPage;
                break;
            case BindableObject bindable:
                page = bindable.GetValue(ViewModelLocator.AutowirePartialViewProperty) as Page;
                break;
            default:
                return Instance.Locate(viewModelType);
        }

        var navService = Instance.Locate<INavigationService>(withKey: PrismApplicationBase.NavigationServiceName);
        ((IPageAware)navService).Page = page;
        return Instance.Locate(viewModelType, new[] { navService });
    }
}
```

## Create the Application Class

Once we've added this single class we only need to add to update our App as follows:

```cs
namespace Prism.Grace
{
    public partial class PrismApplication : PrismApplicationBase
    {
        protected override IContainerExtension CreateContainerExtension() => new GraceContainerExtension();
    }
}
```

As I mentioned, Prism's IOC abstraction only provides the most common functionality. This means that you could find an advanced scenario where you need direct access to the underlying container. To achieve a more complex registration, you can add an extension method like we provide in the Container specific packages:

```cs
public static class ContainerExtensions
{
    public static IInjectionScope GetContainer(this IContainerRegistry containerRegistry) =>
        ((IContainerExtension<IInjectionScope>)containerRegistry).Instance;
}
```
