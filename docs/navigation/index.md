# Navigation

Prism provides Uri based Navigation. Based on the platform you are developing for one or more Navigation methods may be possible. All Prism platforms support the concept of [Region based Navigation](xcref:Navigation.Regions.GettingStarted).

For those developing with the now deprecated Xamarin.Forms or with it's successor .NET MAUI, you can choose to additionally incorporate Page based Navigation.

Whether you are developing using Page or Region based navigation, the API's for these have been updated in Prism 9.0 to provide a greater degree of code sharing. This includes a unified approach to using the INavigationParameters across both sets of API's.
