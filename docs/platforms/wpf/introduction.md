# Introduction

This section contains all of the WPF specific portions of Prism. Unless there is something WPF specific with respect to the following topics, please refer to them at the following locations:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Commanding](../../commands/commanding.md) | Bind actions such as button clicks to your view model |
| [Composite Commands](../../commands/composite-commands.md) | From parent view model, execute commands in child view models |
| [View Model Injection](../../mvvm/viewmodel-locator.md) | Setup Prism to automatically inject your view model based on naming conventions |
| [Event Aggregation](../../event-aggregator.md) | Send messages between components without components knowing about each other |
| [Application Modularity](../../modularity/index.md) | It can be very helpful for testing and maintainability to structure applications in separate pieces without each component being coupled with the others. Prism has some patterns to help with this problem. |
