# Getting Started

.NET Multi-Platform App UI (MAUI) is Microsoft's cross-platform framework for building native mobile and desktop applications.

.NET MAUI however represents a shift in paradigms, with the introduction of the SingleProject, an App Builder with Dependency Injection as a built in first class citizen. As a result there are many differences between Prism.Maui and Prism.Forms.
