This goes back Prism's earliest days. In early Prism 6 versions this was implemented as a boolean flag meaning that if you wanted to opt out of use you just didn't reference it and if you wanted to Autowire the ViewModel you added the property and you knew that Prism would find and resolve the ViewModel and attach it as the BindingContext of your View.
