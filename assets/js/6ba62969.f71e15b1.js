This allows us to ship and to share the containers across all platforms without any specific code coupling to the Prism.Core. In the updated Prism 9.0 implementations support has been added for Microsoft's IServiceCollection. This helps Prism better support .NET MAUI applications and the IHostBuilder approach used by the Uno.Extensions. It is important to consider that when using Registration Extensions from various Microsoft libraries, these will have been tailored to use for Web Applications. For example if using EntityFrameworkCore the default Lifetime of the DbContext will be set to Scoped. For most Prism applications you will likely want to set this to be Transient as a Singleton could cause DbAccess issues if different ViewModels or Services are accessing the database at the same time. Be sure to spend some time evaluating any prebuilt extension methods for registering services so that you can be sure that the service will have an appropriate lifetime for your application."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"containers",children:"Containers"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The Prism team ships several DI container implementations for the Prism IoC abstractions."}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.table,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.thead,{children:(0,s.jsxs)(n.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.th,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Container"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.th,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Availability"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.th,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Notes"})]})}),(0,s.jsxs)(n.tbody,{children:[(0,s.jsxs)(n.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"DryIoc"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"NuGet.org"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Supported across all targets"})]}),(0,s.jsxs)(n.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Grace"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Commercial Plus"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"}})]}),(0,s.jsxs)(n.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Microsoft"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Commercial Plus"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"}})]}),(0,s.jsxs)(n.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Unity"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"NuGet.org"}),(0,s.jsx)(n.td,{style:{textAlign:"center"},children:"Legacy support for WPF only"})]})]})]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.admonition,{type:"note",children:(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"While the DryIoc and Unity Container's are available on NuGet.org they are still subject to the Prism License.
